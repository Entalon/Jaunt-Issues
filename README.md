## Reporting Issues
We thank you for reporting issues with Jaunt. The following section outlines the best way to report issues, what to include, what not to include, and more.

#### How to Report An Issue
Reporting an issue is done via our [GitHub Issue Tracker Repository](https://github.com/Entalon/Jaunt-Issues). Follow the links to report an issue, or visit the `issues` tab to view all active issues.

When reporting an issue, it is important to be as thorough as possible. The more information about the issue, the better the chance we can recreate it and rectify it. Please follow the issue template that is auto-populated when creating a new issue.

#### What to Include and What Not to Include
When reporting an issue, include all information that the issue template prompts for. Also include all additional information that you feel will add context to the situation that might have caused the bug. This might include information such as:
* Steps to reproduce the bug
* The types of actions that the bug effects
* Contextual information such as how many drivers, riders, event dates, etc.

__Please do not include any personal information, or screenshots with personal information.__ Issues that contain such information will be discarded. If you deem screenshots as a helpful aid in rectifing the bug, please remove usernames and other personal information if present.
